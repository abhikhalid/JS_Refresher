/* 
1. Use a constructor function to implement an Electric Car (called EV) as a CHILD "class" of Car. Besides a make and current speed, the EV also has the current battery charge in % ('charge' property);
2. Implement a 'chargeBattery' method which takes an argument 'chargeTo' and sets the battery charge to 'chargeTo';
3. Implement an 'accelerate' method that will increase the car's speed by 20, and decrease the charge by 1%. Then log a message like this: 'Tesla going at 140 km/h, with a charge of 22%';
4. Create an electric car object and experiment with calling 'accelerate', 'brake' and 'chargeBattery' (charge to 90%). Notice what happens when you 'accelerate'! HINT: Review the definiton of polymorphism ðŸ˜‰

// Encapsulation: Protected Properties and Methods

// Encapsulations basically means to keep some properties and methods private inside the class, so they are not accessible from outside of the class. Then rest of the methods are basically exposed as a public interface, which we can call API.

// There are Two Big Reasons why need encapsulation and data privacy. So, first it is to prevent code from outside of a class to accidentally manipulate or data inside the class. Second reason is our code will not break. However javascript classes actually do not yet support real data privacy and encapsulation. Now there si a proposal to add truly private class fields and methods to the language. but it's not completely ready yet! So, we will fake encapsulation. :(

// Encapsulation Private Class Fields and Methods

// Alright, so let's now implement truly private class fields and methods. So private class fields and methods are actually part of a bigger proposal
// for improving and changing JavaScript classes which is simply called Class fields. Now this Class fields proposal is currently at stage three.
// And so right now it's actually not yet part of the JavaScript language. However, being at stage three means that it's very likely that at some point,
// it will move forward to stage number four. And then it will actually become a part of the JavaScript language. And that's probably gonna happen
// some point soon in the future, And that's why I decided to already include class fields in this course. And in fact, some parts of this proposal
// actually already work in Google Chrome, but other parts don't. At least not at the time of recording this video. Now for starters, why is this proposal
// actually called Class fields? Well, in traditional OOP languages like Java and C++, properties are usually called fields. So what this means is that
// with this new proposal, JavaScript is moving away from the idea that classes are just syntactic sugar over constructor functions. Because with
// this new class features classes actually start to have abilitiesthat we didn't previously have with constructor functions.
